Start by running this. _TODO: Confirm this is needed_
`xcode-select --install `

Copy themes to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes


### iTerm2 setup
Navigate to the preferences window (iTerm2 -> preferences). and click on the General tab.
Towards the bottom of the window you should see an option that says
“Load preferences from a custom folder or URL”.
Check this option and select the iterm folder inside dotfiles.
